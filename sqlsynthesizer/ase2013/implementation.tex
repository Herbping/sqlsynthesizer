\label{sec:implementation}

We implemented the proposed technique in a tool, called \ourtool. 
\ourtool uses the built-in PART algorithm implementation in
the Weka toolkit~\cite{Hall:2009} to learn query conditions
(Section~\ref{sec:completion}). \ourtool also uses
MySQL~\cite{mysql} as the backend
database to validate the correctness of each sythesized
SQL query. Specifically, \ourtool first populates the backend database
with the given input tables; when a SQL query is
synthesized, \ourtool executes the query on the database
to observe whether the output matches the given output.
Our implementation is publicly available at:
