\label{sec:implementation}

We implemented the proposed technique in a tool, called \ourtool. 
\ourtool uses the Weka toolkit~\cite{Hall:2009}
to implement the rule-learning algorithm described in
Section~\ref{sec:completion}. \todo{inspect the above}

\ourtool uses MySQL~\cite{mysql} as the backend
database to check the correctness of each inferred
SQL query. Specifically, \ourtool populates the backend database
with the given input tables. When a SQL query is
synthesized, \ourtool executes the query on the database
to observe whether the output matches the given output.
