This section explains \ourtool's 3 steps, as introduced
in Section~\ref{sec:introduction} and illustrated
in Figure~\ref{fig:workflow}.

  \vspace*{-1.0ex}\caption {{\label{fig:workflow} Illustration
  of \ourtool's workflow in inferring SQL queries from input-output examples. \ourtool consists of 3 steps: (1) The ``Skeleton Creation'' step (Section~\ref{sec:skeleton})
infers a partially-complete SQL query as a skeleton from the given
examples, (2) The ``Query Completion'' step (Section~\ref{sec:completion}) uses
a rule-learning algorithm~\cite{} and type-directed search to
produces a list of syntactically-valid query candidates that satisfy
the provided input-output examples.
, and (3) The ``Candidate Ranking'' step (Section~\ref{sec:ranking})
ranks all inferred SQL query candidates and provides users a
ranked list of SQL queries with the likely ones on the top. 
Users select the
desirable SQL queries from the produced ranked query list. On some
examples, if \ourtool produces SQL queries that satisfy the input and
output examples, but does not address the intention that the user wants;
\ourtool can be used interactively by asking users to provide more
informative examples and then refine the SQL queries.

End-users can use our approach to obtain SQL query to transform
multiple, huge database tables by constructing small, representative
input and output example tables. On some examples, we speculate
that our approach
may produce a SQL query that satisfies the input and output examples
given by the user, but does not address the intention
that the user wants. To address this issue, we adapt a simple
interaction model from~\cite{Harris:2011} to ask users to investigate the results of
an output SQL query and report any discrepancy. In this case,
the user can refine the inferred SQL query by providing a more
informative input-output example (or multiple input-output examples
that together describe the required behavior) that demonstrate the behavior on
which the originally-inferred SQL query behaves incorrectly.
