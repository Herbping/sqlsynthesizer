\section{Approach}
\label{sec:approach}



We next describe our approach to infer SQL queries from 
input-output example with a real example as described
in Section~\ref{sec:example}. Our algorithm consists of three steps:
Query Skeleton Creation(Section~\ref{sec:skeleton}),
SQL Query Completion (Section~\ref{sec:completion}), and
Query Candidate Ranking (Section~\ref{sec:ranking}).

\subsection{User Interactive Model}
\label{sec:uim}

End-users can use our approach to obtain SQL query to transform
multiple, huge database tables by constructing small, representative
input and output example tables. On some examples, we speculate
that our approach
may produce a SQL query that satisfies the input and output examples
given by the user, but does not address the intention
that the user wants. To address this issue, we adapt a simple
interaction model from~\cite{Harris:2011} to ask users to investigate the results of
an output SQL query and report any discrepancy. In this case,
the user can refine the inferred SQL query by providing a more
informative input-output example (or multiple input-output examples
that together describe the required behavior) that demonstrate the behavior on
which the originally-inferred SQL query behaves incorrectly.
