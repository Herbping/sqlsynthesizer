\label{sec:approach}

This section first gives an overview of \ourtool's
workflow and high-level algorithm in Section~\ref{sec:algorithm}, and
then explains \ourtool's three steps in details (Section~\ref{sec:skeleton},
Section~\ref{sec:condition}, and Section~\ref{sec:ranking}).

\subsection{Discussion}
\label{sec:uim}

%We next discuss some design issues in \ourtool.

\noindent \textbf{Soundness and Completeness.} The \ourtool
technique is neither sound nor complete. The primary
reason is that several steps (e.g., the Query Skeleton Creation
step in Section~\ref{sec:skeleton}) use heuristics
to infer possible joins, tables used in the \CodeIn{from} clause,
and columns in the \CodeIn{select} clause.
Such heuristics are necessary, since they provide a
good approximate solution to the problem of finding SQL queries
from examples, which has been proved to be
PSPACE-hard and is thus intractable in practice.
Although \ourtool cannot gurantee to infer correct SQL queries
for all cases, as demonstrated in Section~\ref{sec:evaluation},
we find \ourtool
is useful in sythesizing a wide variety of queries in practice.

\noindent \textbf{What if the input-output examples are not
representative enough?}
On some examples, \ourtool may produce a SQL query that
satisfies the input-output examples specified by the user,
but does not address the intention that the user wants.
To address this issue, we use a simple
interaction model~\cite{Harris:2011} to ask users to
investigate the query results and report any discrepancy.
After, the user can refine the inferred SQL query by providing a more
informative input-output example that demonstrate the behavior on
which the originally-inferred SQL query behaves incorrectly.
As demonstrated in our evaluation (Section~\ref{sec:evaluation}),
such an interactive model works fairly well in practice: 
a typical end-user only needs XXX rounds of interactions to
obtain the desirable SQL query.
