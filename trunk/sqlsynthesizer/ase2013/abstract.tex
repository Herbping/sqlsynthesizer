Many computer end-users, such as
research scientists and business analysts, need to frequently query
a database, yet lack enough programming knowledge to
write a correct SQL query.
To alleviate this problem, we present
a \textit{programming by example} technique
(and its tool implementation, called \ourtool)
to help end-users automate such query tasks.
\ourtool takes from users an example input and output of how the
database should be queried, and then synthesizes a SQL query that
reproduces the example output from the example input.
If the synthesized
SQL query is applied to another, potentially larger, database with a
similar schema as the example input, the synthesized SQL query produces
a corresponding result that is similar to the example output. 


%\todo{num is missing here}
We evaluated \ourtool on \exnum exercises from a classic
database textbook and \pnum forum questions about writing
SQL queries.
\ourtool synthesized correct answers for \solexnum textbook
exercises and all \solpnum forum questions, and it did so
with small examples.
