Many computer end-users, such as
research scientists and business analysts, need to frequently query
a database, yet lack the programming knowledge to do such tasks smoothly.
To alleviate this problem, we present
a \textit{programming by example} technique
(and its tool implementation, called \ourtool)
to help end-users automate such query tasks.
\ourtool takes from users an input and output example of how the
database should be queried, and then synthesizes a SQL query that
reproduces the example output from the example input.
Later, when the synthesized
SQL query is applied to another, potentially larger, database with a
similar schema as the example input, the synthesized SQL query produces
a corresponding result that is similar to the example output. 


%\todo{num is missing here}
We evaluated \ourtool on \exnum SQL exercises from a classic
database textbook and \pnum SQL questions raised by
real-world users from online forums.
\ourtool infers correct queries for \solexnum textbook
exericses and \solpnum forum questions, including one question
that received no replies.
