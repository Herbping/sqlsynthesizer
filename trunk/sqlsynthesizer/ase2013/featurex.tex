	\caption{Illustration of two additional features
    added by \ourtool. (Left) An example input table with
    two columns: C1 and C2. (Center) The aggregation features added by
    \ourtool for the input table. (Right) The comparison features
    added by \ourtool for the input table.
    Take the first row in the input table as an example,
    when grouping the table by column C1 (with value 2), the number
    of values in the C2 column is 3; the  number of
    distinct values in the C2 column is 2; the minimal value
    in the C2 column is 1, the maximal value in the C2 column
    is 4, and the average value in the C2 column is 2. Similar
    results can be computed if the table is grouped by the C2
    column.
